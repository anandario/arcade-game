## Use

:rocket: You can open it directly with your browser or use your favourite HTTP server. I like to use this [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer).

## Play

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one of the enemies.

The player can move left, right, up and down. Use your keyboard for this.
